# MoonQuakes 3D Map

This project is a solution for the NASA Space App Challenge 2022 - Make a Moonquake Map! It is a web application that displays information about recorded seismometers during the Apollo missions. The application features an interactive 3D map of the moon, highlighting locations where moonquakes have occurred. These locations are plotted based on data obtained from the gagnepian_2006_catalog. By plotting the detected seismic events on the 3D map, we are able to identify areas on the moon that have experienced the most seismic activity.

## Project Deployment

The project is currently hosted at https://josepabloponce.github.io/MoonQuake-Map. You can visit this link to access the deployed version of the application and explore its features.

## Project Overview and Tools Used

The project showcases information related to the seismometers used in the Apollo missions to gather data about the geological activity of the moon. This information is presented in a simplified manner to make it easily understandable for the general public.

We have developed an interactive 3D map of the moon that visualizes the locations of moonquakes using colored data points. The advantage of this approach is that, being a 3D globe, users can visualize the precise recording locations, enabling more accurate analysis of areas of interest. Our aim was to display all the points where moonquakes occurred and provide the ability to search for a specific location, which would then be highlighted on the 3D map along with the recorded quake's magnitude.

To accomplish this project, we utilized the following tools and libraries:

- "@react-three/drei": "9.32.7"
- "@react-three/fiber": "8.8.7"
- "styled-components": "5.3.6"
- "three": "0.145.0"
- Python
- HTML
- CSS
- 
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
